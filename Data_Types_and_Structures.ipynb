The term \"mutable\" in Python refers to an object's capacity to modify its values. These are frequently the things that hold a data collection.\n","    Immutable Data Types:\n","      Immutable refers to a state in which no change can occur over time. A Python object is referred to as immutable if we cannot change its value over time. The value of these Python objects is fixed once they are made.\n","\n","    List of Mutable and Immutable objects\n","    Python mutable data types:\n","          i.Lists\n","          ii.Dictionaries\n","          iii.Sets\n","          iv.User-Defined Classes (It depends on the user to define the characteristics of the classes)\n","    Python immutable data types:\n","            i.Numbers (Integer, Float, Complex, Decimal, Rational & Booleans)\n","            ii.Tuples\n","            iii.Strings\n","            iv.Frozen Sets\n","\n","3.What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n","        The key difference between tuples and lists is that while tuples are immutable objects, lists are mutable. This means tuples cannot be changed while lists can be modified. Tuples are also more memory efficient than the lists.\n","        \n","4.Describe how dictionaries store data.\n","        Python's efficient key/value hash table structure is called a \"dict\". The contents of a dict can be written as a series of key:value pairs within braces { }, e.g. dict = {key1:value1, key2:value2, ... }. The \"empty dict\" is just an empty pair of curly braces {}.\n","\n","5.Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","        Because sets cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element, it makes sets highly useful to efficiently remove duplicate values from a list or tuple and to perform common math operations like unions and intersections.\n","\n","6.What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","      A string is a sequence of characters between single or double quotes. A list is a sequence of items, where each item could be anything (an integer, a float, a string, etc).The lists and strings are different in following ways : a The lists are mutable sequences while strings are immutable. b Strings store single type of elements all characters while lists can store elements belonging to different types.\n","\n","7.How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","        Tuples are immutable to ensure that their contents remain constant throughout their lifecycle, guaranteeing data integrity and reliability. This immutability allows tuples to be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets, as they can be hashed.\n","\n","8.What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","        A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to compute an index, or hash code, for each key-value pair. The index points to a bucket or slot in an array where the value is stored. Hash tables are efficient and offer O(1) time complexity for average case operations like search, insertion, and deletion.\n","\n","        python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables and the open addressing collision resolution method. The keys of a Python dictionary are generated by a hashing function, and the elements of a dictionary are not ordered and can be changed.\n","\n","9.Can lists contain different data types in Python\n","        In a list, you can store objects of any type. You can also mix objects of different types within the same list, although list elements often share the same type.\n","    \n","10.Explain why strings are immutable in Python\n","      In the String constant pool, a String object is likely to have one or many references. If several references point to the same string without even knowing it, it would be bad if one of the references modified that String value. That's why String objects are immutable.\n","  \n","11.What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","      Dictionaries have several advantages over lists for certain tasks, including:\n","        Speed: Dictionaries are faster than lists for looking up values. This is because dictionary keys are hashable, which means they can be passed to the hash() function to return a hash value. This hash value is then used to look up the associated value.\n","\n","        Ease of use: Dictionaries make code easier to read when generating key:value pairs.\n","\n","        Uniqueness: Dictionaries do not allow duplicate keys, though values can be duplicated.\n","        \n","        Mutability: Values in dictionaries can be updated, and key:value pairs can be added or removed.\n","\n","Here are some other differences between lists and dictionaries:\n","      Ordering: Lists are ordered, while dictionaries are unordered.\n","\n","      Indexing: Lists are accessed by index, starting from 0, while dictionaries are accessed using keys.\n","\n","You can remove items from a dictionary using the following methods:\n","      del: Removes an item by key\n","      pop(): Removes an item by key and returns its value\n","      clear(): Empties the dictionary\n","      popitem(): Removes and returns the last key-value pair.\n","\n","12.Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n","        Use a tuple if you need an immutable collection where the elements won't change after creation. Tuples are generally faster and more memory-efficient than lists, making them better for fixed collections, especially as dictionary keys or when iteration speed is crucial.\n","\n","13.How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","        Items of a set in python are immutable (unchangeable), do not duplicate values, and unordered. Thus, items in a set do not appear in a stipulated manner, i.e., they can appear in a different order every time it is used. Due to this, set items cannot be referred to by key or index.\n","\n","14.How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","        The key of the dictionary is a unique value as well as the set, and the execution time is about the same as for sets. On the other hand, dictionary values can be duplicated like a list. The execution time of in for values() is about the same as for lists. Key-value pairs are unique.\n","\n","15.Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n","      No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple in Python because tuples are \"immutable,\" meaning once created, their contents cannot be changed, added to, or removed; this is a key distinction between tuples and lists, which are mutable and allow for element modifications.\n","    Explanation:\n","    Immutable nature:\n","       The design of tuples is intended to be fixed and unchanging, making them useful for representing data where the order and values need to remain consistent.\n","    Error on modification attempt:\n","      If you try to directly assign a new value to an element within a tuple using indexing, you will receive a TypeError as tuples do not support item assignment.\n","    Workaround:\n","      Convert to list: If you need to modify a tuple, you can convert it to a list, make the desired changes, and then convert it back to a tuple.\n","    \n","16.What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n","      In Python, a nested dictionary is a dictionary inside a dictionary. It's a collection of dictionaries into one single dictionary. Here, the nested_dict is a nested dictionary with the dictionary dictA and dictB . They are two dictionary each having own key and value.\n","\n","17.Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n","      The time complexity of accessing an element in a Python dictionary is O(1), which means it takes a constant amount of time to search for a value in the dictionary. This is regardless of the size of the dictionary.\n","\n","18.In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","      If you need an ordered collection, like a sequence of user actions, lists are your go-to. On the other hand, when you need quick look-ups, like mapping usernames to user data, dictionaries are invaluable.\n","\n","19.Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval.\n","      A dictionary is termed an unordered collection of objects because dictionaries do not maintain any inherent order of the items based on when they were added. In older versions of Python (before 3.7), dictionaries did not preserve insertion order at all.\n","\n","20.E Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","      A list is an ordered collection of items, whereas a dictionary is an unordered data collection in a key: value pair. Elements from the list can be accessed using the index, while the elements of the dictionary can be accessed using keys."],"metadata":{"id":"1eOpA6_4G-m4"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1.Write a code to create a string with your name and print it.\n","name = \"Nithya\"\n","print(name)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"WszJJACKO5o1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1734852040144,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1225,"user":{"displayName":"Nithya J","userId":"03081861764800818025"}},"outputId":"3b181b13-bd87-4e10-c218-1a05492520b3"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Nithya\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 2.Write a code to find the length of the string \"Hello World\".\n","string = \"Hello World\"\n","print(len(string))\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"CuSGYch1PQgA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1734852074123,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":444,"user":{"displayName":"Nithya J","userId":"03081861764800818025"}},"outputId":"e179d564-49bf-4651-a864-9b1c312951e9"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["11\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 3.Write a code to slice the first 3 characters from the string \"Python Programming\"?\n","string = \"Python Programming\"\n","print(string[:3])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"q1AzLZ7vPdY3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1734852090737,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":443,"user":{"displayName":"Nithya J","userId":"03081861764800818025"}},"outputId":"f17349b9-2ccd-44c7-cddd-29b1022f3aeb"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Pyt\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 4.
